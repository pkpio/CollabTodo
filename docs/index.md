---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. A Quick Demo

Requirements:

  * Install app
  	At least on 2 Android devices
  	
  * Connect to Network
  	Devices should be in the same network with multicast support


Running:

  * Open application
  	On both devices. Kill if opened before - gives a fresh start
  	
  * Pull navigation
  	A gesture from ```Left-edge to right```
  	
  * Create list
  	```Add List``` button in navigation
  	 
  * Add entries
  	Use the floating ```+``` button
  	
  * Have fun!
  	It's intutive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Importing code

  * The Project is based on [Android studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html). 
  * The complete Android studio project is available in ```/code``` directory
  * Import project and voila! You have everything you need.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Code structure

**Note:** The core logic is structured into 3 layers

  * <b>UI layer</b>
    All user interface logic. This communicates only with ```Bridge layer```
    
  * <b>Bridge layer</b>
    Forms a communication bridge between the ```UI layer``` and ```Network layer```
    
  * <b>Network layer</b>
    Contains umundo and other support logic to run the backend. Communicates only with ```Bridge layer```
    

**Note:** All 3 layers are implemented in a total of 8 packages 

  * <b>database</b> (Bridge)
  	Handles all database related operations like ```save```, ```fetch``` and ```delete``` on objects
  	
  * <b>dialog</b> (UI)
  	Contains all dialogs used in the application
  	
  * <b>fragment</b> (UI)
  	Contains all fragment classes that are used
  	
  * <b>helper</b> (Bridge)
  	```DeviceUuidFactory``` : Unqiue device id generation
  	```GsonExclude``` : A Gson exclusion strategy to work well with Sugar Database
  	```JsonFactory``` : Converts objects to Json strings and vice versa after applying required strategies
  	```NumberFactory``` : For generating random numbers, strings or hashs fitting certain criteria
  	```Procedures``` : <b>The glueing component of Bridge.</b> Contains ```Local``` and ```Remote``` procedures. More about this below.
  		
  	
  * <b>main</b> (UI & Network)
  	```ApplicationClass``` : Network layer. Initializes backend when application starts and also handles all communication
  	```Interfaces``` : Bridge layer. Interfaces to communicate between fragments
  	
  * <b>models</b> (Bridge)
  	All models or data representations used in the application and network
  	
  * <b>params</b>
  	```Local``` : Parameters specific to a device
  	```Global``` : Parameters related to the network and devices. Example: ```Remote method id```
  	
  * <b>testsuite</b>
  	This contains classes that generate random data for testing. This was particularly handy in developing components independently.
  	


Additional info on ```Procedures```

  * <b>Local</b> :
  	Used for actions occured in the current device. Updates actions into local database. Notifies all remote devices.
  
  * <b>Remote</b> :
  	Used for actions occured on some remote device. Receives changes, updates in local database and triggers UI refresh.
